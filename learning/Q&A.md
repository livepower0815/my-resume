That sounds great to me.
I like fast-paced work environments because they make me feel like I’m always learning and growing, but I really thrive when I’m collaborating with team members and helping people reach a collective goal as opposed to competing.
My last internship was at an organization with a similar culture, and I really enjoyed that balance.

### How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?

I realize stressful situation are always going to come up, and I definitely have had to learn how to navigate them throughout my career.
I think I get better at it with every new experience.
While working on a new product launch at my last company, for example, things were not going according to plan with my team.
Instead of pointing fingers, my first reaction was to take a step back and figure out some strategies around how we could we solve the problem at hand.
Previously, I may have defaulted to panicking in that situation, so being calm and collected was definitely a step forward and helped me approach the situation with more clarity.

### Do you prefer working independently or on a team?

I enjoy a blend of the two.
I like having a team to strategize with, get diverse opinions from, and reach out to for feedback.
But I am also comfortable taking on assignments that require me to work independently.
I find I do some of my best work when I can focus alone in a quiet space, but I really value collaborating with my teammates to come up with the best ideas.

### When you’re balancing multiple projects, how do you keep yourself organized?

I’m used to juggling projects at my current job where I’m often moving between coding one software program to another.
I use the timeboxing technique to make sure they’re all on track, allocating time on my calendar for certain tasks.
I’ve found it really helps me prioritize what needs to get done first, and it holds me accountable for the more repetitive day-to-day tasks I’m responsible for.

### What did you do in the last year to improve your knowledge?

The extra time on my plate really allowed me to get introspective around where I want to take my career.
I read a lot of journals to keep abreast of the latest ideas in my field, and sharpened my skills by taking some online courses, such as…” (and then be specific).

If you chose to work on your personal development, you could say something like the following.

Like everyone else, I, too, gained some time last year from not having to travel two hours a day to and from work.
I decided to spend my time on things I love.
So I got back to learning how to play the guitar and journaling.
I feel it brought me closer to myself and has been really great for my mental health and productivity.

### From your resume it seems you took a gap year.Would you like to tell us why that was?

During my last year of high school, I didn’t feel ready to choose my educational path, so I took a wilderness course for a few months to sort out my life goals.
It may seem a little random, but the time I spent actually helped my develop so many new skills — in the areas of leadership, communication, (etc…).
During that time, I realized that I wanted to earn a degree in (state your degree) to align with my passion (say what that is).
