英文-自我介紹

Hi 你好我叫做 kerry
我畢業於虎尾大學
I graduated from Huwei University

主修的項目是工業管理
my Major is Industrial Management

畢業後從事了本科相關的工作大約 8 年多
After graduating, I worked in this field for about 8 years.

並在 2020 年初開始了前端工程師的職涯
I started my front-end engineer career in early 2020

我第一間公司是做人力外包，我主要負責的產品是客戶關西管理
My first job was at a human resource outsourcing company.
One of my main accomplishments there was developing a system for customer relationship management.

這商品是給保險人員使用的

核心技術是 Vue 框架

這份工作中獲得了蠻多跨團隊合作技巧

同時一些基本技巧也在逐漸成熟

第二份 是一間博弈公司
and then The second job is a gambling company

我主要負責彩票前台的重構，及少許的後台功能串接
I am mainly responsible for the refactoring of the lottery web and implement a few backstage feature

重構部分是由 React 轉乘 Vue
the refactoring part is form React to Vue framework

第三間也就是現在這家，也是博弈公司
After that, I came to my current company which is also a gambling company.

比較不同的是我在裡面主要負責非博弈相關產品，聊天系統。
The main difference is that now I am mainly responsible for non-gambling relat`ed` products, such as the chat system.

由於之前任職的團隊不是一個人就是三人以下。我終於接觸到架構比較完整的前端團隊。這很重要
This is important, because I always worked by myself or in teams of less than three members in the past.
This was my first opportunity to work in a team with more structure

他們在工作分配上劃分明確
They have a clear division of work assignments.

各方面的技術都可以互相交流
We can exchange ideas about any skills and help each other.

在這兩年的時間內我在專案架構的規劃、devOps 層面的知識、甚至是前端團隊工作的安排
都有不錯的發揮空間
I had a lot of room to improve my ability for project structure planning,
devOps knowhow, and assigning front-end tas`ks` to my team members in the past two years.
